# MotoGP Free Practice Analysis
FP4 in MotoGP is usually when riders practice their race simulation. This project aims to find the correlation between the average FP4 laptimes for each rider and their race performance.

The timeline is a 10-year period between 2013 and 2022. The data is taken from the pdf files from the official MotoGP website, e.g. https://resources.motogp.com/files/results/2022/AME/MotoGP/FP4/Analysis.pdf.

Note that this might no longer work if MotoGP decides to change their pdf format in the future.
