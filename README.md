# MotoGP-Free-Practice-Analyser
A python script to automatically calculate the average and best time from each rider. Useful for FP4 particularly, to predict who has the best race pace.

The code takes a pdf file as input and prints its calculation result as output. The pdf file is taken from the official MotoGP website, e.g. https://resources.motogp.com/files/results/2022/AME/MotoGP/FP4/Analysis.pdf.
